# Portfolio Site Upgrade Plan

## Core Identity & Narrative
Position me as a **highly flexible generalist software engineer and prompt engineering expert**. Emphasize rapid adaptation, self-taught versatility across stacks, and the ability to build production-grade solutions quickly—supercharged by LLM/prompt engineering skills.

- Self-taught coder since late 2015, bachelor's in Computer Science (2020).
- Over a decade of hands-on experience rapidly learning and delivering in diverse areas.
- Strengths: Quick prototyping in unfamiliar domains, turning complex needs into efficient tools, and deep system engineering in challenging problems.
- Quant-related projects (e.g., Singularity Social, Autonomous AI Market Analyst) are included as demonstrations of system engineering depth—robust architecture, data integrity, deterministic behavior in complex integrations—not as the primary specialty.
- Overall focus remains generalist versatility.

Tone: Professional, confident, concise—no hype. Focus on verifiable achievements and practical problem-solving.

## Branding: Mandelbrot Set Theme
Build visual branding around the Mandelbrot set for a distinctive, mathematical/aesthetic identity:
- Preserve and prominently feature the existing image: assets/mandelbrot_1.png (use as hero background, header accent, or recurring motif).
- Theme inspiration: Fractal-inspired colors (deep blues, purples, blacks with subtle gradients), infinite complexity representing depth and exploration.
- Subtle integrations: Background patterns, section dividers, or logo elements derived from Mandelbrot imagery.

## Key Skills to Highlight
Broaden and generalize expertise:

- **Rapid Adaptation & Prototyping**: Self-teach any stack quickly (e.g., full Android app in Java early on; ready for Kotlin or others instantly).
- **Prompt Engineering Mastery**: Expert use of LLMs for fast, reliable code generation and complex problem-solving (e.g., building tools in hours).
- **Front-End/UI Development**: Custom Angular component libraries (datepickers, dropdowns, inputs; packaged for npm).
- **Desktop & Tooling**: PyQt6 apps, data pipelines, AI development utilities.
- **Backend & Systems**: Python (Flask, etc.), APIs, integrations; experience with C#/.NET.
- **System Engineering Depth**: Building robust, deterministic, high-integrity systems (demonstrated in complex projects like Singularity Social).

Replace or broaden current "Areas of Expertise" to reflect versatility with system depth.

## Projects to Feature
Prioritize demonstrations of breadth, speed, and engineering depth:

- **ConvoForge (Primary Feature)**: Desktop app for AI data curation and local inference. Built in <5 hours via prompt engineering. Showcase as proof of rapid, practical tool-building. Link: https://github.com/jnlentz/ConvoForge
- **Singularity Social**: Quant-heavy project demonstrating deep system engineering—robust architecture, data pipelines, and deterministic AI integrations. Frame as example of handling complexity at scale.
- **Angular Component Library**: Full custom UI components built from scratch and deployed to internal npm.
- **Android Calculator App**: Early complete mobile app in Java—example of quick self-teaching.
- **Autonomous AI Market Analyst**: Include as further example of system engineering depth (generalize description to focus on architectural rigor rather than domain).

Use cards/grid layout with descriptions, links, and screenshot placeholders.

## Existing Content Notes & Preservation
Current site structure (single-page):
- Header/Intro: "Software Engineer & Systems Architect" → Update to "Versatile Software Engineer & Prompt Engineering Expert"
- My Approach: Generalize to rapid, adaptable problem-solving with emphasis on system depth.
- Featured Work: Promote ConvoForge highest; include Singularity Social prominently as engineering showcase.
- Areas of Expertise: Broaden/replace with skills above.
- Preserve strong CTAs (e.g., GitHub links, case study pages).
- MUST preserve assets/mandelbrot_1.png and integrate it into branding.

## Site Improvement Goals
Refactor the existing site into a cleaner, more organized, modern portfolio:

1. **Structure**: Multi-section single-page (or simple multi-page if better) with navigation menu:
   - Hero/Home (feature Mandelbrot image)
   - About
   - Skills
   - Projects/Case Studies (cards/grid)
   - Contact/Freelance CTA

2. **Design Enhancements**:
   - Responsive, clean, modern (add Tailwind CSS if not present).
   - Mandelbrot branding: Hero background, accents, subtle fractal elements.
   - Subtle visuals: Placeholder slots for screenshots, icons.
   - Dark/light mode optional (dark mode to complement Mandelbrot colors).

3. **Features to Add**:
   - Project cards with hover effects, links.
   - Skills as tags or grid.
   - Clear contact: Email, X (@ZtenlEssej), freelance inquiry CTA.
   - SEO basics: Meta tags for "freelance software engineer", "prompt engineering expert", etc.

Tech: Build on existing stack; add modern utilities (e.g., Tailwind, React/Next if it improves without overhaul).

Proceed iteratively: Analyze current files → Plan changes → Implement → Test locally.
