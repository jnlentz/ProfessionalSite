                                        My experience with databases is rooted in MSSQL. Most of the queries I've built were for dashboards tied to some production
                                        process, where money would be lost if data was not current and accurate.  Database performance was a major concern in most of software 
                                        projects I worked on. I have spent significant time working to reduce the runtime on a query below an acceptable threshold.

                                        A significant portion of my SQL experience comes from troubleshooting SSRS reports.  The warehouse environment worked
                                        in was highly dependent on them.  I often fixed queries for reports that were returning duplicate rows or missing information.
                                        This gave me a front row seat to see how damaging a lack of data integrity can be to productivity.

                                        As a professional I built live dashboards using Python Flask for templating, with some use of jQuery on the front end. I have
                                        also worked with two enterprise Angular apps, both of them front ends for proprietary logistics software.  I also built one standalone

                                        entire warehouse.  We had multiple different Flask apps for different purposes, as well as a huge number of scripts running as

                                        The back end ran as a C# Azure Function.  This was my only C# contribution as my focus there was more on front end.

                                    UI for one of my old trading bots, but that was a long time ago.  That said, I freqently use MatPlotLib to create visualizations
                                    for market research.  I have also used Seaborn and Plotly for the same thing.
